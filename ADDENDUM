Instructions:
    > We had to add a HALT instruction. It is opcode ff.
    > All ALU/Math instructions had to be moved up by one (add starts at 1, 
      subtract is at 2, etc.)
    > The ISA document contains some incorrect obcodes because we did not 
      number them correctly.
        > The relative ordering of the instructions did not change, the 
          instructions were numbered according to appearance order on the 
          ISA document
    > Pop instructions can only pop to registers due to simplicity.
        > Who would pop to memory anyway?

Address Modes:
    > No micro-immediate.
    > 00 in an address mode field causes 0 to be loaded.

Micro-instructions:
    0b11xx
