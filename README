To generate the preprocessed micro-memory run the following command:
    cpp -P mMemory.obj > mMemory.o

This is required because we were not allowed to submit the Makefile.

Aside from this, things are fairly standard. To run a file (for example, example.obj), one simply runs ./CPU example.obj

If you find the output to be too verbose, running the program with the flag -b (for brief/brevity mode) will cut out the microinstruction and only show actual instructions.
    Example: ./CPU -b example.obj

Our tests are as follows:

TestALU.obj:
    Tests ALU instructions.
inc.obj:
    Tests pushing to the stack. Loops until the jump is overwritten by ff000000 being pushed to the stack in the location of the jump.
IllegalOpcode.obj:
    A generic illegal opcode.
Fibonacci.obj
    Obtains the nth fibbonacci number in register 3. (sequence starts with the 1st fibonacci number being the second 1, 2nd being 2, etc.)
